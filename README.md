# OrderManagementSystem
* I ran out of time and did not complete much of the client side functionality, though the basic Spring framework supporting security and webmvc is largely there.

* Wiring up of the rest endpoints to business logic is missing, though the business functionality has been implemented, with some tests demonstrating use of mocks, verification, argument capture, etc.

* Concurrency aspects of the system have not been considered due to time limitations

Again, time was the big constraint for me on what was quite an enjoyable exercise!
